Problem Statement:

You need to arrange books in a library with the help of students.
Each student has a collection of books. Bookshelves can hold a maximum of K books and must be fully filled to be counted.

Extra books carry forward to the next student

If books are insufficient, they also carry forward

Leftover books after the last student are discarded

Input Specification:

input1: Integer representing number of students

input2: Integer K, shelf capacity

input3: Integer array representing books each student has

Output Specification:

Return the total number of fully filled bookshelves

Approach:

Maintain a running sum of books

Whenever total ≥ K → form a shelf

Carry forward remaining books using modulus (%)

Program:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class BookshelfCounter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int students = sc.nextInt();
        int K = sc.nextInt();

        int currentBooks = 0;
        int shelves = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < students; i++) {
            currentBooks += sc.nextInt();
            shelves += currentBooks / K;
            currentBooks = currentBooks % K;
        }

        System.out.println(shelves);
        sc.close();
    }
}
