📝 Problem Statement

You are organizing a field trip and want to divide students into two equal-sized groups:

One group with even-numbered IDs

One group with odd-numbered IDs

Your task is to return the maximum number of students that can be included in both groups.

🔢 Input Specification

input1: Integer N, number of students

input2: Integer array of student IDs

🎯 Output Specification

Return the maximum number of students included

💡 Approach

Count even IDs

Count odd IDs

Result = 2 × min(evenCount, oddCount)

💻 Java Code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class StudentGroupDivision {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int N = sc.nextInt();
        int evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            int id = sc.nextInt();
            if (id % 2 == 0)
                evenCount++;
            else
                oddCount++;
        }

        int result = 2 * Math.min(evenCount, oddCount);
        System.out.println(result);

        sc.close();
    }
}
