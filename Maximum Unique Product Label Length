📝 Problem Statement

You are a product designer working for a company that manufactures various products.
You are given two strings, each representing a set of product label characters.

Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the maximum possible length of a product label that can be created by:

Taking characters individually from the first string, or

Taking characters individually from the second string, or

Combining characters from both strings

Conditions:

All characters in a product label must be unique

No character should be repeated

🔢 Input Specification

input1: A string value

input2: A string value

🎯 Output Specification

Return an integer value representing the maximum possible length of the product label formed under the given conditions.

🧪 Example
Input
hea
oed

Output
5

💡 Explanation

Characters from first string: h, e, a

Characters from second string: o, e, d

Combined characters: h, e, a, o, e, d

Unique characters: h, e, a, o, d

✔ Total unique characters = 5

🧠 Approach

Use a Set to store characters

Add all characters from both strings into the set

Since a set stores only unique elements, duplicates are automatically removed

The size of the set gives the required answer

💻 Java Code (User Defined Input)
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Set;

public class ProductLabelDesigner {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input strings
        String input1 = sc.next();
        String input2 = sc.next();

        Set<Character> uniqueChars = new HashSet<>();

        // Add characters from first string
        for (char ch : input1.toCharArray()) {
            uniqueChars.add(ch);
        }

        // Add characters from second string
        for (char ch : input2.toCharArray()) {
            uniqueChars.add(ch);
        }

        // Output result
        System.out.println(uniqueChars.size());

        sc.close();
    }
}

⏱️ Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N + M)

Space Complexity: O(1) (limited character set)
